## Description

The program Local File Sender or more simple LFS is a java program made with Swing.  
The propuse of it is to send file of all dimension to a pc from another with IPv4.  
It's a very user friendly program because all the option are visible and if something or some input is wrong, the program throw an GUI error with JOptionPane.  
Why i made it?  
Becuase i wanted to send a file from my local pc to another local pc, but i saw that none made a program like that (maybe because is useless **:/** ).
